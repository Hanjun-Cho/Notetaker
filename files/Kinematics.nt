Difference Between Vector and Scaler: Vector has a magnitude and direction while Scaler has only magnitude
Magnitude: Amount of the Vector or the value of the Vector without a direction
Component Vectors: Remember to break vectors into their respective components (x, y)

Distance: How far something goes (path travelled) <- Scaler
Displacement: Straight line distance from start to end (includes direction) <- Vector
How to calculate displacement -> final position - initial position = displacement or xf-xi=S

Speed: Distance/Time <- Scaler
Velocity: Displacement/change in time <- Vector 
Acceleration: change in velocity/change in time <- Vector

MOTION GRAPHS
The slope of a position time graph is Velocity
The slope of a velocity time graph is Acceleration
The area of the curve under the acceleration as a function of time graph is Change in Velocity
The area between the curve and the axis for the velocity time graph is Displacement
Be careful of the graph themselves, thats how your dumb brain messed up FRQs last summative

Free Fall -> ay -> -g -> -9.81m/s^2
Gravity on Earth -> g -> 9.81m/s^2

Uniformly Accelerated Motion (UAM)
vx=vx0+axt
x=x0t+vx0t+1/2axt^2
vx^2=vx0^2+2ax(x-x0)
displacement = 1/2(vf+vi) * change in time
the variables: vf, vi, a, displacement, change in time

PROJECTILE MOTION
When an object is flying in 2 directions, you split the known variables in x and y direction. We already know that X velocity is constant with no acceleration while the y direction has a constant acceleration of free fall.
The equation you need to solve for the velocity of the x is displacement/change in time
The UAM equations are all you need to solve for the variables in the y direction
Use trigonometry to get the magnitude of the velocity

CENTER OF MASS
We just need to understand center of mass qualitatively and not quantitatively
Center of mass basically the point on the object where all forces on applied on (Free Body Diagrams will be done based on the Center of Mass)
Basically if we have two objects and one of them has a higher mass, the center of mass will be closer to that object than the lighter one.
