Inertial Mass: The measure of an object's Inertia or its resistance to acceleration
Gravitational Mass: Used to determine the Force of Gravity or Weight of an Object (Force of gravity = mass * gravity)

NEWTONS LAWS
First law: An object at rest will always be at rest, an object in motion will maintain constant velocity unless met by net external force (remember the net)
Second law: F=ma (Force is equal to the mass * acceleration) <- Draw Free Body Diagram, identify the direction(s), and object(s)
Third law: For every force applied by an object an equal and opposite force is applied to the object applying the force

FORCES
Gravity (Fg) = weight and is always down (Fg=mg)
Normal (Fn) = perpendicular to the surface and is a push force
Newtons (N) = kg*m/s^2
Friction (Ff) = parallel to surface and opposes motion (|Ff|<=u|Fn| u=coefficient of friction)

FRICTION
Static: Non moving (2 objects don't slide relative to one another) <- Fs = Fapplied (force of static friction = Applied Force)
Kinematic: Moving (2 objects slide relative to one another) <- Fk = uFn (force of kinetic friction = Normal Force * coefficient of friction)
Static Force is always equal to Applied Force when the object is in equilibrium
Kinetic Force is always equal to the coefficient * normal force
It's harder to put something in motion than it is to keep it moving (also why the static force is going above the kinetic force and the kinetic force is a straight line below the highest point of the static force line)

Translational Equilibrium: Net force is = 0 meaning it's either at rest or moving at a constant velocity (no acceleration)
